# Ekto

## About

Ekto is a publishing platform built to provide an easy way to integrate blog
content into websites, i.e. a blogging microservice. It includes an online markdown
editor so you can write blog posts online and save them in the Ekto database. Then
the Ekto API provides an interface to query for your blog posts and display them
on your website.

## Getting started

This project consists of a Ruby on Rails API and a React app. See the README's in
[/server](https://github.com/bnhansn/ekto/tree/master/server) and
[/client](https://github.com/bnhansn/ekto/tree/master/client) to run locally.

## Demos

There are two sister blog templates built to demo how to use the Ekto API.

* Ava (React app): [Source](https://github.com/bnhansn/ava) - [Online demo](http://demo.ekto.tech)
* Eve (Node + Express + React app with server side rendering): [Source](https://github.com/bnhansn/eve) - [Online demo](http://eve.ekto.tech)
